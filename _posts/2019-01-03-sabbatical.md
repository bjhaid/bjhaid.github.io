On the 3rd of February I would have spent 5 years working for PayPal hence I am
due for a 4 weeks sabbatical.

Right now I am hoping to provide some form of value for 3 out of the 4 weeks
available to me, if you are reading this you are probably interested in what I
have worked on in the past few years and what kind of value I can provide, do
find all the details below:

### What I worked on

#### Senior Software Engineer (2014-2017) Braintree PayPal

- Help scale Braintree's core funding application reducing the time batch jobs
  took to complete from days to minutes in some of the cases.
- Help build out Braintree's instant sign on experience in Europe.
- Help scale Braintree's payment gateway introducing a bunch of
  micro-optimizations that saved hundreds of milliseconds.
- Helped rebuild Braintree's CI system [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) leveraging
  [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for significant improvement in build time.
Gave a talk about this at DevopsDays Chicago 2016
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG2_acl-Ks4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG2_acl-Ks4).
- Continuous maintenance of Braintree's CI infrastructure.

#### Member of Technical Staff (Architect and Technical Lead) (2017-present) Braintree PayPal

- Led architectural decisions for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) at
  Braintree.
- Led implementation and adoption of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) at
  Braintree.
- Continuous maintenance of Braintree's [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  infrastructure.


### What kind of value can I provide?

While [I love to write software](https://github.com/bjhaid) and I **DO NOT**
plan to write software during this period as I am not convinced that writing
code will be the best use of my time and this arrangement, so find below ways I
believe I can add value:

- Help introduce and envagelize agile practices.
- Help introduce Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- Help adopt containers.
- Help review new and existing architectures.
- Maybe pair program.
